# OpticsExpert
Python and GUI based linear beam optics simulation code for the beam line design.
It performs beam optics calculations such as MadX (CERN) or TRACE3D (LANL), and all design variables can be adjusted using Graphical User Interface. 

This code was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2017R1D1A1B03036184).
